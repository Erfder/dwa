#Deployment plan
##Setting up the server
the server needs to be configured with the needs of very few users or data, as it is a single html page with no social or business prominence.
##Git
+ Create new git branch if necessary
1. Checkout the branch you are working in
2. Develop
3. Git add 
4. Commit with a message
5. Test branch
6. Merge to master branch
7. Review any changes to master branch
8. View on staging server
9. Push to server master branch
If any problems arise, loop back to step 2
